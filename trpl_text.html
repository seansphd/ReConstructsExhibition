  <h1>TRPL: Comments on TRPL</h1>
  <h2>Robert Mallary (USA), 1974</h2>

  <p>Robert Mallary’s <em>TRPL</em> is a plotter-graphics program that interpolates evenly spaced lines between pairs of pre-designed master lines. Under certain arrangements, these interpolations generate striking Moiré patterns, the result of three interacting factors: the opposing master lines, the shifting regularity of the spacing scheme, and the absolute regularity of the plotter grid.</p>

  <p><em>TRPL</em> was created on an incremental plotter at Amherst College, where the pen’s stepwise movement in fixed increments across or at 45 degrees produced the characteristic wavy tremor of plotter-drawn curves. This low-resolution device, moving in 100 steps per inch, was essential to the emergence of the Moiré patterns. When implemented on a higher-resolution 200-step plotter at the University of Massachusetts, the patterns weakened or disappeared, showing how a machine’s limitations can be central to the artistic result.</p>

  <p>The system consists of a main program, written by Mallary, and subroutines developed with Dr. Roger Ehrich, including XFIT, which generates smooth curves from coordinates, and DGRAF, which uses these curves to calculate spacing schemes. Parameters such as drawing height, width, number of interpolations, and scaling factors must be carefully coordinated to optimise results. Multiple master pairs can be combined within a single drawing, although Mallary often retained visible discontinuities to emphasise colour shifts.</p>

  <p>For Mallary, <em>TRPL</em> demonstrates the creative potential in working with the constraints of a medium. While its imagery relates to Op Art, he saw its value in renewing an area of visual exploration that had faded from the art world before computers could influence it.</p>
