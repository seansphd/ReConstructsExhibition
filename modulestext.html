  <h1>Modules / Structures / Relationships: Ideograms of Universal Rapport</h1>
  <h2>Manuel Barbadillo (Spain), 1964–1970</h2>

  <p>Spanish artist Manuel Barbadillo developed a distinctive modular art system during the 1960s that explored how simple geometric units could be rotated, mirrored, and colour-inverted to create complex visual compositions. His approach treated each module as both a form and an organised portion of space, designed to connect seamlessly with others. Barbadillo’s early work focused on a single square-based module from 1964 to 1968, later expanding the system to include additional modules with similar structural characteristics.</p>

  <p>In 1969–70, working at the Centro de Cálculo de la Universidad de Madrid with programmer Lorenzo Carbonell Soto, Barbadillo used computers to study systematic combinations of module variations. These were arranged into larger “molecules” and repeated, rotated, or mirrored across a grid, producing intricate patterns. The process combined strict geometric logic with intuitive aesthetic decision-making, revealing a deep interplay between order and variation.</p>

  <p>Barbadillo’s work anticipated later developments in generative and computational art by showing how a finite set of elements could produce infinite formal diversity. His concept of “sympathetic” relationships between opposites — colour reversals, mirrored orientations, and positional inversions — created an adaptable visual language that bridged manual and computer-assisted processes.</p>
