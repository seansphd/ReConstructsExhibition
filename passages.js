      "These are not restorations. They are interpretive models — attempts to resurface procedural ideas and logics that once shaped digital artworks.",
      "The question is not what the work looked like, but how it worked, and what we might learn by building with what remains.",
      "Each 'construct' reimagines a lost computer artwork from the archive.",
      "Curatorial inputs were translated into structured prompts. The system searched for procedural logic beneath missing code and incomplete records."
