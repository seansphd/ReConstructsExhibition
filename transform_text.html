  <h1>The Transformation Program</h1>
  <h2>Colin Emmett (UK), 1970</h2>

  <p>Colin Emmett’s <em>Transformation Program</em> was an early computer graphics system designed to morph any line drawing into any other, producing a sequence of intermediate images that could be recorded frame by frame on 16mm film. Initially developed using a graph plotter at Time Sharing Ltd. in London, the program later generated images on a Tektronix storage tube display, with plans to produce animations on a Stromberg-Carlson 4020 microfilm plotter.</p>

  <p>Written in TELCOMP and later reworked in FORTRAN, the program treated each image as a collection of straight-line vectors, distinguishing between visible and invisible lines. Emmett developed three transformation methods. MAPPER equalised the number of points in two shapes by subdividing or duplicating vectors; GANGER inserted zero-length vectors between existing ones; and SHADOW calculated vector lengths and projected one shape onto another, producing more sensitive transformations at the cost of increased computing time.</p>

  <p>Once correspondences between points were set, the program generated intermediate stages by incrementally shifting each point’s coordinates. Vector sequence, point numbering, and relative orientation strongly influenced results, sometimes creating inside-out transformations. The system included routines for generating circles, polygons, and letterforms, with scope for naturalistic handwriting. As a creative tool, it could be used to build complex forms from earlier transformations, blurring the boundary between technical process and artistic invention.</p>
