  <h1>Field Work 3: A Structured Arena</h1>
  <h2>Timothy Drever (UK), 1969–1970</h2>

  <p>Timothy Drever’s <em>Field Work 3</em> was conceived as an experimental environment in which participants could explore the interaction between a stable, rhythmic structure and the changing forms of human activity. Building on earlier participatory works, Drever shifted focus from the transient results of audience actions to the patterned ways those actions were shaped by the structures provided.</p>

  <p>The proposed work took the form of a large arena with a floor of shallow, evenly spaced waves, designed to create a specific walking rhythm and alter perception through different lighting and sensory conditions. Objects such as balls, fragile rods, or pools of water could be introduced, changing the arena’s character and producing new patterns of interaction. Performers, musicians, and dancers could further engage with the floor’s periodic structure, creating layered interferences between movement and form.</p>

  <p>Drever’s design was also rooted in mathematical analysis. A triangular wave array, modelled on the interference of three sets of parallel waves, produced a repeating pattern of maxima, minima, and saddle points. This underlying geometry generated shifting triangular and circular patterns over time, suggesting a dynamic relationship between symmetry, rhythm, and transformation. The work bridged environmental art, performance, and mathematical modelling, anticipating the possibilities of both physical installation and computer simulation.</p>
