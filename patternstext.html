  <h1>Computer Structures</h1>
  <h2>Peter Struycken (Netherlands), 1970–1971</h2>

  <p>Peter Struycken developed a generative system for creating complex black-and-white patterns from a fixed set of sixteen modular elements. Compared to his earlier 1970 structures, these new works introduced greater redundancy, allowing similar underlying arrangements to produce varied visual results through controlled randomness.</p>

  <p>In one example, a composition appears from a distance as four large square blocks, each following the same diagonal arrangement of smaller modules. While the structural scheme is identical, the assignment of modules to positions is randomised separately for each block, ensuring visual differences within a shared framework. Other works extended this approach to larger grids — such as 7×7 blocks of 4×4 modules — with either consistent diagonal arrangements or fully random internal orders. In each case, the numerical layout remained fixed, but the mapping of modules to numbers was re-randomised for every block, multiplying variation.</p>

  <p>The method combined precise structural planning with stochastic variation, demonstrating Struycken’s ongoing interest in modular systems, seriality, and perceptual complexity. By fixing compositional logic while introducing controlled randomness, he produced patterns that balanced predictability and surprise, inviting close visual inspection as well as appreciation from a distance.</p>
